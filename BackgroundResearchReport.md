## Background Research Report

_3. The kind of decisions, interventions, or actions that analysis results could support 
(e.g., management actions, advocacy for policy changes, etc.)_

Based on our Research Questions. 

There is no integrated research report and although you coordinate your choice of topic/focus, each student turns in the report individually. Each student's report should be 1200-1500 words. The main goal is supporting effective analysis and interpretation, so make sure you're focusing on topics that give you useful background for the methods, topic, and organizational context of the data!
